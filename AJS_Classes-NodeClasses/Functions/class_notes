functions:
    - functions are the set of statements
    - functions are meant for implementing the business logic
    - by using we can reuse the business logic
    - We have two types of functions
       1.Named JS Functions
       2.Anonymous JS Functions
       3. Arrow Functions (ECMA6)

   Named JS Functions: The function with the name called as named JS Functions
   Anonymous JS Functions: The functions without a name called as Anonymous Functions


Syntax.
    //create the function
    function fun_name(){
        //Business Logic.
    };

    //calling the function.
    fun_name();


functions with return value
---------------------------

    - generally each function at the end of the defination will return the result.

    - we can return the result with the help of "return" statement.


Syntax.

    //creating the function
    //defination of function
    function fun_name(){
        //Business Logic
        return "result";
    }


    //call the function.
    var result = fun_name();
    console.log(result);




functions with arguments
------------------------

    - while writing the defination of function we can pass the arguments to functions.


Syntax.
    //function defination
    function fun_name(arg1,arg2,arg3,......){
        //Business Logic;
    }


    //call the function
    fun_name(arg1,arg2,arg3,.....)




Anonymous functions:
--------------------
    - The function without a name called as Anonymous functions

Syntax.
    //creating the anonymous function
    var fun_one = function(){
        //Business Logic.
    };

    //call the anonymous function
    fun_one();
